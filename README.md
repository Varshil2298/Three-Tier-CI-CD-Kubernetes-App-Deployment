# Three-Tier CI/CD Kubernetes App Deployment

## Application Code
The `Application-Code` directory contains the source code for the Three-Tier Web Application. This is where you can delve into both the frontend and backend components to explore their implementations.

## Jenkins Pipeline Code
In the `Jenkins-Pipeline-Code` directory, you'll find Jenkins pipeline scripts tailored for the backend and frontend. These scripts are designed to automate the CI/CD process, streamlining integration and deployment of the application.

## Jenkins Server Terraform
The `Jenkins-Server-TF` directory contains Terraform scripts for provisioning the Jenkins Server on AWS. These scripts simplify the setup and management of your infrastructure.

## Kubernetes Manifests Files
The `Kubernetes-Manifests-Files` directory includes Kubernetes manifests required for deploying the application on AWS EKS. These files are structured to follow GitOps best practices, and they are located in a separate repository to ensure efficient management and version control.

## Project Overview
